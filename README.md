<h2>Future Vision</h2>
<p>Currently, Sealena resides only in the web platform. We are working in the arrival to other platforms such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IOS</li>
  <li>Android</li>
  <li>Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be moving to Enterprise level, and also provide companies such as Hospital Chains a centralized way to distribute patients to their respective doctors. As well a way for Laboratories to advertise their services and grow their clientes flow.</p>
<p>Patients also have a place in these future innovations. We will provide patients a place to store all their medical records, request appointments remotely and be able to talk to their primary care doctor.</p>
<p>We are aiming to become the top Medical Information Management and Collaboration platform. A centralized place where individuals can store their medical information safely and access it from anywhere at any time without any problems.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>Technologies we used for our Back-End:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Django</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons why Python/Django was the way to go to build Sealena. In the main reasones we have the variety of tools they provide out of the box, the security and mainly the scalability. As mentioned in the previous section, our target is to make Sealena the top Medical Information Management and Collaboration platform and scale larger.
</p>
<p>Technologies we used for the Front-End:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted Sealena to be a Web Platform, we used these technologies to build it. We will be using other technologies in the future to provide users
   a better User Experience (UX).
</p>
<p>Technologies we used for Data Visualization:</p>
<ul>
    <li>D3.js</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to use D3.js as our Data Visualization library. D3 eases the way we give life to our data by providing us with tools out of the box
   to manipulate and visulize data instantly. By making use of Canvas or SVG we were able to build up dynamic visualizations based on the data retrieved
   from our server.
