        We defined our dunder __call__ method to make sure the class instance can be called as a function.

        a get_response callable.
        Finally we define our __call__ dunder method, this way any TimezoneMiddleware instances can be called as funcs,
        just before we call our view we will collect the data needed from the user's profile. If the timezone was
        collected we will activate it using the timezone.activate() method. If there is no timezone, then the timezone
        will be deactivated using the timezone.deactivate() method. Finally our response will be returned calling the
        get_response callable and passing the request object as it's parameters.
